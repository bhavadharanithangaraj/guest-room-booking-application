# guest-room-booking-application

I can't able to give the github direct link for run my application beacuse the private repository does not support it.So you have to follow the installation step I mentioned below.

Installation/Run the application

1. You have to install the xampp-server for run the php application.Open the xampp server,turn on/start the sql and apache.
2. Download the zip file from my github repository.
3. (MOST IMPORTANT STEP) You have to extract and save the zip file in above mentioned file location (xampp-htdocs-create a new folder and save the zip file in           it) eg: It must be like this xampp/htdocs/your folder name/extracted zip file.
4. After that you can go to chrome/browser and type the url localhost/foldername that you gave while you save the extracted file eg: localhost/grba
5. That's it.
